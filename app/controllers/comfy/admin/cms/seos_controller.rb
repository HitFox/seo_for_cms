# Build a Page where you render "Some page telling user to wait" do a 
#   AJAX call to the controller action which imports the contacts from 
#   facebook and do the render in this action AFTER the import has finished and 
#     you should be fine! When the AJAX response is received replace the waiting message 
#     with the result from the server! â€“  alex Apr 7 '12 at 11:19
